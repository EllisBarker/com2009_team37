Task 1 uses a time-based decision-making process for determining the loop of the figure eight that it is currently on that may be affected by the ROS node's connection to the wireless access point.
If the WaffleBot stutters or completely stops pre-emptively during the roslaunch for any reason, 'rosrun com2009_team37 task1_move_figure_eight.py' is an alternative to run the same code.
